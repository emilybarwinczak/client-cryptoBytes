### User Stories
User can create a profile to visit a page to learn more about what cryptocurrencies are, then have a dashboard that shows the top cryptocurrencies (stretch goal: ticker of general crypto news stories a la News of the World), the user can select coins to add to their "Follow" list and upon pressing on one, be led to a show page that shows a line graph of the specific coin's historical data. (stretch goal: make this run in "real-time" using websockets). The show page will also display a ticker of news stories specific to that coin. The user will be able to note down their thoughts on individual coins.
